# CloudFlare-Firewall-Ruleset-for-Wordpress

This is a list of rules for the free version of CloudFlare firewall which is optimized for Wordpress websites.

We all know that we have 5 free rules included on the free plan of CloudFlare but we can include multiple rules inside a rule in CloudFlare so we try to keep the number of rules files at maximum 5 and obtain the best results.

Please feel free to contribute to this rules if you have new ideas.
